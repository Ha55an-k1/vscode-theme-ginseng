## Credits
This theme was inspired by the color scheme of [Arizona Ginseng Green Tea](https://www.google.com/search?q=arizona+green+tea&rlz=1C1CHBD_enCA856CA856&oq=arizona+green+tea+&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0l6.4594j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

P.S I'm not being paid by them, I just really like the color scheme :)
